# SQL_SSIS_Clinic_DataBase

Author : Gyubeom Kim

I created an entire ETL solution. Before the process of making it, I reviewed the whole data structures by reviewing all data diagrams on the documents. I also organized data that I need for the project because organizing is the key for the complex database design. Then, I started to utilize SQL, SSIS, and SQL Agent Job for the project.

# Summary
For conducting the project for creating an entire ETL process using various tasks. Firstly, I reviewed whole data and created OLTP database. Then, I put data from some files to the OLTP. As putting the data in OLTP database, I was able to insert it into the newly created data ware house. In data warehouse, I created whole processes as stored procedures as a process of creating ETL; therefore, I could successfully execute my ETL processes in the SSIS package. Then, I made a SQL Agent job for back up three databases on the assigned destination. Through all that steps, I could end with the project.
